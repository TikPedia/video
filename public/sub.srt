1
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:14,844
They're going in!
Wait for me, for fuck's sake!

2
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:20,570
Come on, for fuck's sake.
You're so slow! Hop on.

3
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,887
They're betting 1200 on
who jumps in the lake first.

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,688
Come on. It's so cold.

5
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,963
Wait for me, for fuck's sake!

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,728
- Go. Jump in!
- No, I don't want to.

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,400
It's freezing.

8
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:09,767
Shit, I have a cramp.

9
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,049
- Fucking hell!
- Coming!

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,124
Put him in the recovery position.

11
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,561
Pump his chest a little.

12
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:35,206
Don't fuck him up!

13
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,287
- Did you check the eel traps?
- I want 600. I came second.

14
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,324
There's hot toddy in the car.
Come on, boys.

15
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,664
<font color="#cfbf7e">THE HUNT</font>

16
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,646
Something fishy's going on here.

17
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,043
Oh, it's you, Pelle!
Are you alone?

18
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,966
- Get him! Get him!
- You're too many!

19
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,491
Watch out! I'm dangerous.
This is my new weapon, Pelle.

20
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:23,127
- Hang up your clothes.
- I have to go number two.

21
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,483
Lucas can help you, then.

22
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,561
Would you please help him?
All his clothes come off.

23
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,967
Is jumping such a great idea?

24
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,965
- I'm done.
- Can you handle it yourself?

25
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,484
- Hello! Wipe.
- Hey, watch your tone.

26
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,604
Come here.

27
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,246
And soap.

28
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,571
Come on.

29
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,801
Hi, Klara. Something wrong?

30
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:15,608
- I'm lost.
- Oh. Where's Mum and Dad?

31
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:20,009
At home.
I forgot to look where I was going.

32
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,602
All of a sudden I was here.

33
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,807
You still can't step on the lines?
So you don't know where you're going?

34
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:34,801
- No, and I don't remember the way.
- That's a shame.

35
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,283
I remember the way.
Why don't we go together?

36
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,328
I'll look up
while you look at the lines?

37
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:48,809
I'd like that.
Is Fanny coming too?

38
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:52,561
- Yes, she's coming too.
- Good. She'll watch out for us.

39
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,966
- What's your favourite dish?
- Probably venison.

40
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,405
Mine's fish fingers.
Why do you work in our nursery?

41
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:12,527
Well, I was a teacher at your
brother's school, but then it closed.

42
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,287
My dad says you're sad because
you live alone in a big house.

43
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,368
Does he now?

44
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:25,929
Keep your head high
and your feet on the ground.

45
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,283
If you are still sulking,
you can get a kick up the arse.

46
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:36,811
- Did your dad teach you that?
- You can get a kick up the arse.

47
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,689
- Can I come and walk Fanny?
- As often as you like.

48
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,724
Try calling her.

49
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,923
- Fanny!
- Louder.

50
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:52,806
Fanny! Come here!

51
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,801
- Klara, where have you been?
- At the supermarket.

52
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,051
Sweetie. Haven't I told you
not to run away from home?

53
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:07,046
- You want coffee?
- Fanny, come.

54
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,125
- Go to your room.
- Shit!

55
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:15,404
- Look what I found in the gutter.
- Hi, Lucas.

56
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,091
Hi, Fanny.
Who's a good girl?

57
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,240
Hi, babe. You didn't put that thing
away like you promised.

58
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:27,125
Do you also leave
your sporting gun lying about?

59
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,049
I've told you, it's a rifle.
It's not a sport.

60
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,680
- Torsten!
- Torsten!

61
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:40,200
Young lady,
you have some thinking to do.

62
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,489
We're off to buy football boots.

63
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,082
Don't touch the pie! I mean it!

64
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,726
It better be in one piece.
Torsten, are you coming?

65
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,887
Drop in one of these days.
We'll make lasagne.

66
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,525
Lasagne...

67
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:12,248
She'll be furious.
Like that. I got it.

68
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,489
How are things
with Marcus and your ex?

69
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,329
Everything's fine.

70
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,288
I can tell when you're lying.
Your eye twitches.

71
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,041
- Really?
- Don't lie to me, Lucas.

72
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,286
She'll only let me see him
every other weekend.

73
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,210
Call Kirsten.

74
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:43,087
Forget the lawyers.
Quiet, Fanny!

75
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,524
Then don't mention Kirsten.
Stop it, Fanny!

76
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:53,522
- Do you miss Marcus?
- Of course I miss my boy.

77
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:57,725
- Pick up the phone and call Kirsten.
- Stop!

78
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,970
- Down, stupid dog!
- Stop it.

79
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,128
Shame on you!

80
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,770
He's unhappy that it's twelve days
at your place and two at mine.

81
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:14,043
<i>I think it works fine.</i>

82
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,249
Can I say something?
Thank you.

83
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,603
He wants to spend
more time here.

84
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,122
He said that
you were okay with it.

85
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,481
Isn't that true?

86
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,561
<i>Lucas, what else could he say?
He feels sorry for you.</i>

87
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,447
- Come again? He feels sorry for me?
<i>- Of course!</i>

88
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,963
- Please behave like an adult.
<i>- You have to set yourself aside.</i>

89
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:45,404
I do, damn it!
He was the one who asked.

90
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:50,287
<i>You can't even keep an agreement.
You're not supposed to call me.</i>

91
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:56,206
When are we supposed to talk,
if you don't call, and I can't call?

92
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:58,328
When can we talk then?

93
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,240
<i>- I'm hanging up.</i>
- No. When can we talk? Kirsten?

94
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:32,366
Old rod, big rod, crooked rod,
wrinkly rod...

95
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:35,643
- Rod, rod, rod!
- Hi, Klara.

96
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,730
Look, Klara.
A giant stiff rod.

97
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:43,971
- Let's go to my room.
- Massive hooker rod!

98
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,890
- Good morning, Klara.
- Good morning.

99
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:02,610
<i>- Listen, you have to take her.
- You never keep an agreement!</i>

100
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,131
<i>We don't have an agreement!</i>

101
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,290
Are they arguing? Are you sad?

102
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,007
No, he can have
a kick up the arse.

103
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:17,331
<i>If you have children,
you must take them to nursery!</i>

104
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,924
- Shall I take you to nursery?
- I'd like that.

105
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,010
I'll let your dad know.

106
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:30,205
- Hi. You're making a racket.
<i>- We can't find Klara.</i>

107
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:34,848
- She's here. Why don't I take her?
<i>- Yes, of course. Bye.</i>

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,401
It's okay. Let's go.

109
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:45,882
You can look where we're going,
then I'll look out for lines.

110
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:33,205
You're so weak!

111
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,490
Who wants to fly?

112
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,680
- Me too!
- Come here, then.

113
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,282
I need a break. I'm dying here.

114
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,007
- Me too!
- Me too!

115
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,966
- He's dying.
- Yeah!

116
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:01,847
- Wake up!
- Come on, wake up!

117
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,282
Who's waking the dead?

118
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,290
Here's the hand of death.

119
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,047
Time for fruit.

120
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:22,442
We'll be right there.
Clean up first. Klara...

121
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:29,406
I found a small present
in my coat pocket.

122
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,646
I think you should give it
to one of the boys.

123
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,850
- It's not from me.
- But it says "Klara".

124
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,967
Then someone must be teasing you.

125
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,807
Why don't you give it to your mum
or the person who made it?

126
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,367
And kissing on the lips
is only for Mum and Dad.

127
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:06,208
It's not from me.
You're lying.

128
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:12,485
- It's not from me.
- Klara?

129
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,607
Boys. Tidy up.
And wash your hands.

130
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:22,123
- Are you serious?
- Yes, I am.

131
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:27,531
Hi, Pelle and Janus.

132
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,211
Hi, sweetie. Are you still here?
Your mum will be here in a minute.

133
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:44,602
Excited about Christmas?

134
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:51,121
Do you remember the carol?
Let's sing it.

135
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,963
I hate Lucas.

136
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:07,607
- I thought you were friends.
- We're not.

137
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,210
Why not?

138
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:15,645
He's stupid, and he's ugly.

139
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,922
- And he has a willie.
- Most men do.

140
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,727
So does your dad and Torsten.

141
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:35,289
Yes, but his is pointing
straight out. Like a rod.

142
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:41,850
- Why do you say that?
- Because it does.

143
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,210
Did something happen, Klara?

144
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:53,725
He gave me this heart,
but I don't want it.

145
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,208
That's no good.
Then throw it away.

146
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,409
Is Santa coming this year?

147
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:10,570
Yeah... You never know.

148
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:16,210
- I think he will.
- If you've been nice, he will.

149
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:22,202
Hi, Grethe. Hi, sweetheart.
Are you sitting in the dark?

150
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:28,447
I'm so sorry.
I came as fast as I could.

151
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,651
Did you have fun?
Something on your mind?

152
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:39,448
No, we've collected mushrooms
and turds in the woods today.

153
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,565
Sounds nice!
Come on. Let's go home.

154
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,890
- See you, Klara.
- Bye, Grethe.

155
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:51,368
Come, sweetie.

156
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,690
Let's hurry home and make dinner.

157
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:12,601
Okay. Wow.
I'm thrilled to hear that.

158
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,647
- Did something happen?
- Bye-bye, see you!

159
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:23,290
- Did you talk about it?
<i>- Yes. He wants to live with you.</i>

160
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,724
<i>- He's very angry.</i>
- It'll be perfect.

161
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,128
I'll take him to yours
as often as he wants.

162
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,528
Are you okay?

163
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,401
<i>You'd better talk to him.
I'll go get him.</i>

164
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,847
Sorry. I'll just go through here.

165
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:49,444
<i>Dad? It's great. But I can't
change schools before Christmas.</i>

166
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:53,485
- We'll manage.
<i>- I'd better go and see to Mum.</i>

167
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,686
Okay. And Marcus,
be nice to her. It's not easy.

168
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:03,283
<i>- Of course. Bye.</i>
- I love you. See you soon.

169
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,731
- Sorry. Hi.
- Hi.

170
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:18,123
That was my son.
He's going to live with me now.

171
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,410
Coffee...

172
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,608
Coffee now? Here?

173
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,131
Yes.

174
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:37,086
Let's have some coffee.
You want milk?

175
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:40,124
No. I want it black and strong.

176
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:58,206
<i>You're supposed to be gentle, right?
Do the dishes.</i>

177
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:13,929
Just like this?

178
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,283
Thank you.

179
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,966
- Will you clean up the playground?
- Sure.

180
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,050
- See you tomorrow.
- Monday.

181
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,807
- Tomorrow.
- No, on Monday. It's weekend.

182
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,202
I like it when we can see each other.

183
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,122
Me too.

184
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:26,122
Come here.

185
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,964
You're sweet.

186
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,050
You too.

187
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,120
Let's put it here.

188
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:58,005
You can't even hit the sack.

189
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:02,364
It's the first time
I didn't shoot anything.

190
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,529
It really is.

191
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:11,124
Perhaps it's your eyes.
You might want to try these.

192
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:26,004
Listen. I'll call Ulla.

193
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:30,205
You bring roast pork.
Eel. Black pudding.

194
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:34,245
- Johan! Apple pork.
- Let's just say cheers.

195
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,125
You'll bring apple pork.

196
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,920
Hello. It's Lucas. Hello?

197
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:52,527
I can't hear a thing. One moment.
Hello, Lucas here.

198
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,886
It's me.

199
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,888
<i>Pussy! Pussy!</i>

200
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,930
I've been thinking about you a lot.

201
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:18,806
- Who did you call? A bird?
- Bent, stop it!

202
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:23,209
Hey, I'm quietly trying to tell you,

203
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:26,563
that he made a phone call
to a lady!

204
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:38,804
<i>Would Lucas, would Lucas,
would Lucas drink a beer?</i>

205
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:51,569
<i>Oh surely, oh surely,
oh surely he would!</i>

206
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,127
<i>Oh surely, oh surely,
oh surely he would.</i>

207
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:03,651
- I brought a present.
- And it's not even Christmas.

208
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:06,525
Come on. I'll help you.

209
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:11,009
- How much did he drink?
- I don't know. Lost count.

210
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,968
- Thank you so much.
- Lucas...

211
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:22,211
You're my best friend.

212
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:28,208
- See you. Have you got him?
- Kisses.

213
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:33,811
I'll call if I need you.
Goodbye.

214
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:38,004
Agnes...

215
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,446
I need to tell you something.
Do you know why you're so pretty?

216
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:50,248
- No.
- Because you don't know.

217
00:24:55,560 --> 00:25:00,043
- Oh, honey.
- I love you.

218
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:07,810
I love you.

219
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:11,322
I love you. A lot.

220
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:39,446
Fanny. Fanny.

221
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,528
Fanny, where are you?

222
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,564
Come here. Come!
Thank you for the ball.

223
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:29,086
I got you! First time ever!
Got you!

224
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:42,487
- Lucas. Lucas!
- Hi.

225
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,207
- You can't escape me.
- Do you have a minute?

226
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,285
Yeah, just a second.
Boys, I can't catch you.

227
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:54,200
After I drink some super juice,
I'll be back.

228
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:00,888
- Hi, Grethe.
- Please take a seat.

229
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:06,211
- How's little Marcus?
- Good. He's not so little anymore.

230
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,926
He's planning to move in
with me before Christmas.

231
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,001
I've been racking my brain,
but I can't get it out of my head.

232
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:26,411
A child has told me something,
I need to talk to you about it.

233
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,521
This child has a vivid imagination,
but I still wanted to mention it.

234
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:36,041
Sure.
Who are we talking about?

235
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,089
I can't tell you.

236
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:51,525
The child says things have happened.
Things meant for adults only.

237
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,810
What things?
What has happened?

238
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:02,562
The child says that
he or she doesn't like you.

239
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:10,041
And that he or she has seen
your private parts...

240
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:23,687
How the hell would that
even be possible?

241
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,370
I don't know.

242
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,005
Shit...

243
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:40,127
It doesn't sound good,
but don't worry.

244
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,249
I'm not jumping to conclusions.
We'll work it out.

245
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:50,808
- What exactly has been said?
- I can't tell you.

246
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,204
And it's time for fruit
so we'd better move on.

247
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:05,806
You should take a few days off.
Then we'll sort this out.

248
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:09,686
Finish your shift today,
and then we'll think of something.

249
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,723
I'll do that.

250
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:50,248
- Did I keep you waiting?
- No, it's fine.

251
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:54,081
I'm not sure how this works.

252
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,131
Let's just get started.

253
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,686
Yes, Klara...

254
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:09,923
Can you try to tell me exactly
what you told Grethe?

255
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:29,562
Please tell him
what you said about the heart.

256
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,242
I didn't say anything.

257
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:46,609
Is Grethe just making this up?

258
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:50,489
Or did you make it up?

259
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,204
No.

260
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:56,766
Alright...
Then try telling me.

261
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:07,010
It's okay to tell him.

262
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:15,043
Is it true that you said

263
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,568
that you had seen Lucas' willie?

264
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,049
Try to tell me what Lucas did.

265
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:39,443
Tell me about that, Klara.

266
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:46,488
- I'd like to go out and play.
- You just have to answer.

267
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,730
Don't be afraid.
Ole won't hurt you.

268
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,446
He just wants to know
what's happened.

269
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,522
Did he show you his willie
here in the nursery?

270
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,851
Did he, Klara?

271
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,085
Klara?

272
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,403
You are nodding.

273
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,807
So it was here in nursery?

274
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:39,091
Tell me what happened, then.

275
00:33:41,040 --> 00:33:44,522
Grethe said that
you said it was pointing.

276
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:49,004
Was his willie pointing?

277
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:54,202
I think so. I don't remember.

278
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,641
So he showed you his willie?

279
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,249
Is this uncomfortable to talk about?

280
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,845
Is that because you don't like
what he did?

281
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:30,085
Klara, you're doing a great job
answering my questions.

282
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,726
We'll be done soon.

283
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:41,327
What did he do
after he showed you his willie?

284
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,647
I don't really know.

285
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,204
Did you touch it?

286
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:54,644
Do you remember?

287
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,610
Did...

288
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,323
...something white
come out of it?

289
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,008
Perhaps this is too much at once.

290
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:16,567
You can go back out and play.

291
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,890
- Really?
- We just need to keep an eye on her.

292
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:32,846
You and I know each other,
which is fine,

293
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,046
but this is actually a matter
for the police.

294
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,886
And we need the consent
of her parents.

295
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,766
I appreciate your help.
I'm not sure how to handle it.

296
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:50,566
Klara has a vivid imagination.

297
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,570
But it doesn't seem to be the case.

298
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,324
No, it doesn't appear that way.

299
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,209
No.

300
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:13,007
Ole says that we have to report it.

301
00:36:13,120 --> 00:36:15,327
We have to notify the authorities.

302
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:24,404
- The parents' meeting is off, then.
- I don't think so.

303
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:27,410
We're obliged to inform
the other parents.

304
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:33,844
- Where's Klara?
- She's outside playing.

305
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:37,648
Where's Lucas?

306
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,606
He's also outside playing.

307
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:45,088
- Shouldn't we send him home?
- Yes, we'd better.

308
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,207
Hi, Grethe. We were on our way
to football when you called.

309
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:25,081
- Please take a seat.
- I thought it was at 7:00 pm?

310
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,285
- Is everything okay?
- We need to talk about Klara.

311
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:34,247
Perhaps Torsten should wait outside.

312
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,809
Wake up. Go and text or
play some games. I'll be right out.

313
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:47,960
What has she been up to,
that little rascal?

314
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:55,603
Something has occurred that shouldn't
occur between children and adults.

315
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:59,964
I haven't been able to prevent it.
I'm terribly sorry.

316
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:03,880
Klara has recounted
sexual details about an adult.

317
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:08,490
I don't believe
a child would lie in that way.

318
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:17,120
It sounds very confusing.
What are you telling me?

319
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,531
It seems that Klara has been
a victim of sexual abuse here.

320
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,564
Probably by someone close to you.

321
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,247
- Sexual abuse?
- The things she said...

322
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,361
She'll probably deny everything
because she's embarrassed.

323
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:39,804
But...

324
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,802
How?

325
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,324
Let's see how bad it is.

326
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:59,007
Hi. The cake is here.

327
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:03,364
- Hi! Is it lactose free?
- Yes.

328
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:30,330
May I have your attention?
We have a new item on the agenda.

329
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:40,081
We suspect indecent conduct
towards the children.

330
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:49,721
There are indications that an adult
has abused one of the children.

331
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,606
Theoretically there might be
more than one victim.

332
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:04,288
You should be on the lookout
for certain symptoms.

333
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,884
Bedwetting, headaches and nightmares.
This evening we'll go into details.

334
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,641
I'll ask you to read this pamphlet.

335
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:17,924
This is a very serious accusation.

336
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,930
Yes. But there's no need for panic.

337
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,762
We will of course follow
procedures to the letter.

338
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,080
Good morning, Marcus. Hello?

339
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,211
Hello?

340
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,643
<i>- Dad...</i>
- Why are you whispering?

341
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:54,367
<i>They won't let me call you.</i>

342
00:40:56,840 --> 00:41:01,801
Who won't allow you?
Did something happen?

343
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:08,042
Marcus, are you crying?

344
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,683
<i>They're saying all these things
about you.</i>

345
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:15,041
<i>I'm not allowed to talk to you.</i>

346
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:18,044
<i>- Or allowed to move.</i>
- Who said that? Your mother?

347
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,731
<i>They said that something disgusting
happened in the nursery.</i>

348
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:32,402
Don't listen to them. It's not true.

349
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:38,006
- Who called you?
<i>- Grethe from the nursery.</i>

350
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:47,685
Just go to school.
I'll talk to you tonight.

351
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,408
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Don't worry about it.

352
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:02,206
I should have told you... Sorry.
Yesterday...

353
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,450
I was told that a kid had said
I had shown him my willie.

354
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,210
Or to her.

355
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,805
Yes.

356
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:32,325
Now Marcus' mother
also knows about it.

357
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:48,681
- Hi.
- Hi.

358
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:52,607
Boys, not now.

359
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:58,410
- Is Grethe in?
- I thought you were on leave.

360
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:00,045
I just need to...

361
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,969
What are you doing here?
What's going on?

362
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:14,128
- I need to talk to you.
- I'm in the middle of something.

363
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:25,004
You'd better go home.
Leave Grethe alone.

364
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,441
Grethe.

365
00:43:30,440 --> 00:43:32,044
Grethe, come here.

366
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,964
Stop it.

367
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,323
Why are you leaving?
This is absurd.

368
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,081
Don't come here
when I've asked you not to.

369
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:46,727
- I'm not hurting anyone.
- Stop right there!

370
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,050
- How could you do it? It's sick.
- What did I do?

371
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:57,560
- It's wrong to be here with you.
- Let me tell you what's wrong.

372
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:03,369
You called Marcus' mother,
and now he's not allowed to come.

373
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,608
What do you suppose he's thinking?

374
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:09,641
I believe the children.
They don't lie.

375
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:15,926
You leave Marcus alone.
Do you understand?

376
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,126
You leave my children alone.
Klara is an innocent, little girl.

377
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:25,970
Is it Klara?
Grethe, is it Klara?

378
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,368
We'd better stop now. Let's go.

379
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,643
What did she tell you?

380
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:36,526
It's my best friend's daughter.
You know that, don't you?

381
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,767
Shit, it's Klara.
I have to talk to Theo.

382
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:50,411
What are you doing here?
Why is Ulla in the office, crying?

383
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,650
- You'd better leave now, Lucas.
- What the hell?

384
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:58,207
We have nothing to say
to each other. Go.

385
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,443
- Have you gone mad?
- I might have. Off you go.

386
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:06,922
Go away, Lucas.

387
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,845
Hi, Theo.

388
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:41,883
I think we need to talk.

389
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,485
Yes...

390
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,288
Okay.
The others are asleep. Come on.

391
00:45:57,840 --> 00:46:00,525
Let me get a drink.

392
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:22,609
I've made lemonade.

393
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:26,724
If you're thirsty...

394
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,211
Thanks.

395
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:34,211
Now, listen...
We have to talk about this.

396
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:39,891
Yes.

397
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,523
What are they saying?

398
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:52,445
You have to ask your daughter.
They don't tell me anything.

399
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,609
It's blown out of all proportion.

400
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,600
You and I have to sit down
and figure out what's happened,

401
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:06,681
and then go to Grethe
before all hell breaks loose.

402
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:20,050
You want me to ask Klara?
Is that what you want?

403
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:23,409
Of course.
What do you mean?

404
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:29,771
Lucas... I know my little girl.
She doesn't lie. She never did.

405
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,329
Why would she be lying now?

406
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:44,962
I don't know why, but she is.

407
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:59,450
- Lucas, for fuck's sake.
- I didn't touch your daughter.

408
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,527
You know that I didn't.

409
00:48:12,880 --> 00:48:16,282
Do you believe me or not?

410
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:21,323
I don't know.

411
00:48:25,640 --> 00:48:30,806
- Theo, I didn't touch your daughter.
- I don't know, Lucas.

412
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,810
- He's not supposed to be here.
- Probably not.

413
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,043
- You must go now.
- What did I do?

414
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,771
What is it you think I did?

415
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:00,011
Shut up! Get out!
I don't want to talk to you!

416
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:05,365
Bastard. Don't sit in our sofa.
I never want to see you again.

417
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,324
I'll cut your dick off. Get out!

418
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,203
Hey, Lucas...

419
00:49:12,360 --> 00:49:14,328
Are you insane?

420
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:19,685
If you touched my daughter,
I'll put a bullet in your head.

421
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,485
And I think you did,
because she says so.

422
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:27,244
Do you want to ruin my life?
Do you?

423
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:30,648
- Look at me!
- What are you doing?

424
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:35,290
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi, Lucas.

425
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,485
Klara, go to your room.
Agnes!

426
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:44,522
Come, let's go to the living room.

427
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,650
Is Dad sad?

428
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:54,207
He'll cool down. You know that.

429
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:00,048
- Let's sit here and wake up.
- Are you mad at Lucas?

430
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:08,685
- Let's just sit here.
- He didn't do anything.

431
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:15,206
I just said something foolish.
Now all the kids are talking.

432
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:29,521
Honey...
It's difficult to understand.

433
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,326
But perhaps it's like this.

434
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,250
Your mind prefers not
to remember what happened.

435
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:43,366
It's unpleasant to think about,
but, Klara, it did happen.

436
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:48,488
And we're so happy
that you've told us.

437
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,084
Right, honey?

438
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,641
Come. Let's have some cookies.

439
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:13,046
Hi, Nadja.
Please come in and sit down.

440
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,842
You've probably heard about it.
We've reported the incident.

441
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:37,089
We have informed the parents
about the symptoms of abuse,

442
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,206
and they've asked their children
if they've had any nightmares...

443
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:50,404
A number of parents
reported symptoms of abuse.

444
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,522
So we had to act.

445
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,924
Are you seeing Lucas?

446
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:36,971
Lucas has walked Klara here.
They've been seen together.

447
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:42,683
He's been alone with the children.
In the toilets and the soft play room.

448
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,764
Kirsten, it's me again.
Please call me.

449
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,330
She doesn't answer.

450
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,084
Perhaps,
but I need to talk to Marcus.

451
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:13,281
What did they say in nursery?

452
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,050
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

453
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:39,201
- What are you doing here?
- Can I walk Fanny?

454
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:43,121
Okay. Of course.

455
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:48,326
Does your mum know you're here?

456
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:56,290
You need to talk to your mum
before you come over.

457
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:06,201
They say that
you did bad things to me.

458
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,447
Do you believe that too?

459
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:25,489
I don't know.
I don't really remember.

460
00:54:33,560 --> 00:54:39,442
- What did I do, sweetie?
- I don't remember anymore.

461
00:54:39,560 --> 00:54:41,847
It's also the others.

462
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,211
Who are the others?

463
00:54:51,560 --> 00:54:54,404
Klara, who are they?

464
00:54:54,520 --> 00:54:56,249
I'm scared.

465
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:06,607
Do you want to go home?

466
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:14,286
- What about Fanny?
- You can walk her another day.

467
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:17,963
You'd better go home now.

468
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,204
What?

469
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,729
What do you think?

470
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:08,041
What do you mean?

471
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:16,202
Do you think I'm insane?

472
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,849
Do you think I'm insane?

473
00:56:34,040 --> 00:56:36,441
You'd better go. Get your things.

474
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:41,763
Come... I want you to leave.

475
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:55,004
I've harmed a child. Is that
what you're saying, you idiot?

476
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,600
Get out. Out!

477
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,961
- Look, it's snowing.
- Right on the elf.

478
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,241
Yes.

479
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:23,769
Let's put this one on the lake.

480
00:57:23,880 --> 00:57:27,009
Yes. They're skating.

481
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,886
- Where's he going?
- You decide.

482
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,211
Here.

483
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:40,085
Yes.

484
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,531
And this one up there...

485
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:49,961
Then he can see everything.

486
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,965
Shouldn't he join the others?

487
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:06,449
It's snowing!
Don't you want to see it?

488
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:10,360
- I'm coming.
- It's so pretty!

489
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,890
Don't get cold.

490
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,211
What the hell?

491
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,560
Marcus?

492
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:52,520
Is it you?

493
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:56,201
- Sorry. Come here.
- You scared me.

494
00:59:56,280 --> 00:59:59,966
- I didn't mean to. Are you okay?
- Yes.

495
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:04,326
Hi, Fanny, old girl.

496
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,210
- Does Mum know you're here?
- Yes.

497
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:18,203
- Where the hell is the key?
- I gave it to someone.

498
01:00:19,960 --> 01:00:22,770
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

499
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:28,209
- What a mess. It looks like shit.
- Come here...

500
01:00:28,320 --> 01:00:29,845
Stop it already.

501
01:00:32,800 --> 01:00:36,771
Mum suggested that
I drop by to say hello.

502
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,724
- Shouldn't you be in school?
- Well...

503
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,086
I took a couple of days off.

504
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,683
You know that things
aren't normal around here.

505
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,451
I've been fired.

506
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:56,566
The police are involved,
but they tell me bugger all.

507
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,681
I'm going crazy.

508
01:01:03,040 --> 01:01:05,486
Mum doesn't know you're here,
does she?

509
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:14,051
- Does she?
- Fuck, man.

510
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,089
I'm crying again...

511
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:30,481
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

512
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:39,291
- It's okay.
- I'll pull myself together.

513
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:41,562
It's ridiculous, man.

514
01:01:54,040 --> 01:01:56,122
- Hi.
- Hi.

515
01:01:56,240 --> 01:02:00,211
Well, if it isn't my godson.
Hi, Marcus.

516
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:03,802
- Hi.
- Do you have time to be here?

517
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,282
- The air is a little dry in here.
- Coffee?

518
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,765
Yeah.

519
01:02:14,200 --> 01:02:18,808
Did you talk to the police?
What did they say?

520
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,371
They asked a bunch of questions.

521
01:02:24,480 --> 01:02:28,201
Evidently,
I've touched other kids as well.

522
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:31,126
- It's insane.
- Completely.

523
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:35,642
What? Bloody hell,
you didn't do anything!

524
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:41,645
It's all of them now.
It's Johan, it's Bent...

525
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:45,321
They've gone raving mad.

526
01:02:48,520 --> 01:02:52,764
You've always put up with too much.
I've told you before.

527
01:02:55,680 --> 01:02:59,685
Alright, Fanny. Kirsten!

528
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,768
Yes. Still got it!

529
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:08,482
I don't know...

530
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,601
Thanks. It'll be alright.
Marcus is here now...

531
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:21,202
Neglecting to pour
his godfather a cup of coffee.

532
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,767
- What about your hunting license?
- October 16th.

533
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:29,010
The day when men become mice,
and mice become men.

534
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,490
Call Mum and say you're here.

535
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,571
And Marcus? If she flares up,
I'll put her in her place.

536
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:08,610
- That'll be 269.50.
- Here you go.

537
01:04:12,120 --> 01:04:15,329
- Thank you. Here's 30.50.
- Thanks.

538
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:23,728
- Hi, Marcus. Is your dad with you?
- No.

539
01:04:23,840 --> 01:04:28,243
Tell him that neither of you
are welcome here anymore.

540
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:34,480
- Why?
- We have other customers.

541
01:04:35,760 --> 01:04:37,524
You're not welcome.

542
01:04:58,640 --> 01:05:02,008
- What's going on?
- Is that your son?

543
01:05:07,320 --> 01:05:11,723
Can I...? Call Mum and tell her
to pick you up.

544
01:05:11,840 --> 01:05:15,401
I've been arrested. I need to go.
Are you okay?

545
01:05:16,760 --> 01:05:20,685
Jump in. The opposite seat.

546
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:36,484
Fuck, man!

547
01:05:56,080 --> 01:05:59,766
- Hi, Marcus.
- Do you have a key to our house?

548
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,201
A key? I don't think so.

549
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:12,443
- I'm off, then.
- Marcus, are you okay?

550
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:17,603
- Yes.
- Listen...

551
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:22,883
We know they picked up your dad.

552
01:06:26,680 --> 01:06:31,891
Can I have a word with you?
Can I have a word?

553
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:34,404
Yes, but we...

554
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:40,083
Come on in. Are you hungry?

555
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:46,127
Go and say hello to Marcus.
Klara, can you find the mugs?

556
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:49,767
- Hi, Marcus.
- Hi.

557
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,642
Well... See you.

558
01:06:58,560 --> 01:07:02,246
Hi! He's sat in there...

559
01:07:15,800 --> 01:07:18,690
We can give you a lift.

560
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:21,800
Or call your mum.

561
01:07:29,560 --> 01:07:33,645
Marcus, are you okay?
Are you okay?

562
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:40,767
I just wanted to ask
if you'd help my dad?

563
01:07:40,880 --> 01:07:45,044
Help your dad? How?

564
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:47,965
Could you think it
all through again?

565
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,480
You're such a good boy,
and I understand your feelings.

566
01:07:54,600 --> 01:07:57,524
You shouldn't pay
for his mistakes.

567
01:07:57,640 --> 01:07:59,927
But he hasn't done
what you say.

568
01:08:01,960 --> 01:08:06,602
- Honey, go to your room.
- I want to tell her something.

569
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,284
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

570
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,569
Are you doing all right?

571
01:08:15,840 --> 01:08:18,889
- Why are you lying about my dad?
- I'm not.

572
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:24,211
- Let's go, Klara.
- I just want to talk...

573
01:08:24,320 --> 01:08:26,926
- Let go!
- Stop it!

574
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:31,921
- Don't touch her.
- You're out of here.

575
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,123
- I've had it with you.
- I just want to talk to her.

576
01:08:35,240 --> 01:08:39,723
- Why do you lie about my dad, bitch?
- Oh no, you didn't!

577
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:44,448
- Get him out of here.
- I want to talk to her!

578
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:45,971
Enough already.

579
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,322
What the hell?

580
01:08:50,200 --> 01:08:54,444
Johan, for fuck's sake! Stop it!

581
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,122
Stop it. Get away from him!

582
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:03,841
Get up and go home.

583
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:07,681
- Go home.
- Fucking assholes!

584
01:09:07,800 --> 01:09:09,723
Come on.

585
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:14,365
Fucking assholes!

586
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:32,809
Hi, Marcus. Good to see you.
Come on.

587
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:35,651
You're exhausted.

588
01:09:41,800 --> 01:09:45,361
- Did someone hit you?
- No.

589
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,764
Young ladies, keep it down.

590
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,486
Some relatives are staying over.

591
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,762
Come on, Marcus.

592
01:10:01,880 --> 01:10:05,646
My two sisters.
You met them when you were a child.

593
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:11,244
- I haven't seen you for a long time.
- We call them Chip and Dale.

594
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:16,366
They're cracking nuts.
My old man is helping your dad.

595
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:25,247
This is Lucas' boy, Marcus.
Elias and Erik. My brothers in law.

596
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,405
I'm Erik. This bastard is Elias.

597
01:10:30,520 --> 01:10:35,890
- Sit down. Get him some water.
- Are you thirsty?

598
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:42,242
- Is tap water okay?
- Thanks.

599
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:45,204
I've spoken to your mum.

600
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:48,210
Remember to phone home.
Agreed?

601
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,528
Do you know
what's happening to Dad?

602
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,651
What did dad say?

603
01:11:02,760 --> 01:11:08,802
He said that Lucas has
a preliminary hearing tomorrow.

604
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,367
At 8:30 am.
There are two possible outcomes.

605
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,963
Either the judge
confirms the remand.

606
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:22,211
Or he finds no basis
for keeping him.

607
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,966
What do you think will happen?

608
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,404
I don't know.

609
01:11:34,360 --> 01:11:39,241
Apparently, all the children
are telling the same story.

610
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:46,850
They describe your basement,
the wallpaper, the colour of the sofa.

611
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,489
But when the police searched
your house this morning,

612
01:11:52,840 --> 01:11:54,808
they discovered what, Marcus?

613
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:02,883
- That we don't have a basement.
- Exactly.

614
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:07,801
- What does that mean?
- That they don't have a basement!

615
01:12:07,920 --> 01:12:13,211
- What does it mean for Lucas?
- It means there's still hope.

616
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:19,441
It's common for children
to describe non-existing details.

617
01:12:19,560 --> 01:12:23,451
I don't know
if it's their imagination,

618
01:12:23,560 --> 01:12:27,451
or they pick it up from each other
or from their parents.

619
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:30,530
It's always assumed
that children tell the truth.

620
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:34,691
And unfortunately,
very often they do.

621
01:12:37,640 --> 01:12:42,362
- Now what?
- We'll have to wait and see.

622
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:46,923
They'll call us tomorrow.

623
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,887
Good morning, lad.

624
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,529
Sleep well?

625
01:14:04,040 --> 01:14:06,611
I've brought you bread,
cheese and coffee.

626
01:14:06,720 --> 01:14:07,960
Thanks.

627
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:12,045
I need to talk to you.

628
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:19,005
I'm your godfather,
and you can count on me.

629
01:14:21,200 --> 01:14:23,646
No matter what happens. Okay?

630
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:32,083
I've just spoken to your dad.
It looks good.

631
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,329
- He's on his way in a taxi.
- What?

632
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:37,329
They let him go.

633
01:14:37,440 --> 01:14:40,330
Eat your bread
and drink your coffee.

634
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:45,207
Then we'll go downstairs
and welcome your dad.

635
01:15:09,480 --> 01:15:14,122
Hey! If you fondle your kid,
you'll go back to jail.

636
01:15:14,240 --> 01:15:16,846
We've got bacon and eggs.
It won't eat itself.

637
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,009
- Come on.
- It's good to see you.

638
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,566
Fanny! Hi, Fanny-girl.

639
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:30,722
It's not too messy. You two,
grab a shovel and dig a basement.

640
01:15:30,840 --> 01:15:35,289
- Fanny has peed on the floor.
- No. It's probably the police.

641
01:16:04,440 --> 01:16:07,762
- Fanny!
- She'll be here in a minute.

642
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:19,047
Do you want me to wash
the knickers I found?

643
01:16:22,440 --> 01:16:26,764
- Do you?
- What's your point?

644
01:16:26,880 --> 01:16:30,930
Nothing. I just asked
if you want them washed.

645
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:34,567
- Yes, if you can find them.
- I will, in a minute.

646
01:16:35,840 --> 01:16:39,925
If you put them in the wash.
Are you seeing each other?

647
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:42,520
I thought so.
Then all this happened.

648
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:48,285
I wanted you to meet her,
but we'll see.

649
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:56,241
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No, it's not my thing.

650
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:01,402
- Having a girlfriend?
- No.

651
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:08,846
- I remember Jasmin.
- That's more than a year ago.

652
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:20,770
Stay down. Don't move.

653
01:17:31,400 --> 01:17:33,528
Hello!

654
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:42,365
Hello!

655
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,443
What's that?

656
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,881
- Dad, what is it?
- Go back in, Marcus.

657
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:31,970
Let's go back in.

658
01:18:33,600 --> 01:18:37,525
- Come on in.
- Forget it, man.

659
01:19:01,320 --> 01:19:05,245
- You're dead!
- Stop it.

660
01:19:05,360 --> 01:19:08,603
- Relax...
- Fucking dead! Let go of me!

661
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,530
- Stop it!
- I'll kill you!

662
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:18,845
I'll kill you!
Bring her in. She's cold.

663
01:19:32,920 --> 01:19:34,331
Lucas?

664
01:19:44,360 --> 01:19:47,091
I'd like to be alone.

665
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:49,202
Where's Marcus?

666
01:19:51,680 --> 01:19:54,809
- You sent him back to his mum?
- Yes.

667
01:19:58,440 --> 01:20:03,765
- Please leave, Bruun.
- Come on in.

668
01:20:03,880 --> 01:20:06,406
Go home, when I tell you to!

669
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:10,044
Just go.

670
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:53,682
- Here you go. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Per.

671
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:59,729
- I'd like two chops.
- We don't have chops.

672
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,001
- Sorry, I mean those pork chops.
- You can't buy anything here.

673
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:18,410
- I have a right to shop here.
- I want you to leave.

674
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,844
- You need to leave. Scram.
- I want two chops.

675
01:21:37,080 --> 01:21:40,926
Off you go.
Don't come here.

676
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:51,849
- You're not welcome.
- You can't hit a person like that.

677
01:21:51,960 --> 01:21:54,930
You have to leave now.

678
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,210
- Is it normal to hit someone like that?
- Get out.

679
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:01,681
I can walk!

680
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:11,764
- I need my stuff.
- Get out! Now!

681
01:22:16,480 --> 01:22:21,042
- Get him out.
- Not a moment too soon.

682
01:22:21,200 --> 01:22:24,329
Get out!

683
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:27,091
Thank you for coming.

684
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:32,923
Get lost.

685
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:36,044
Bugger off.
Don't come here ever again.

686
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:38,724
Stay away.

687
01:23:28,240 --> 01:23:33,121
Didn't I tell you to get lost?
I won't tell you again.

688
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:37,207
I just want to say something.

689
01:23:40,680 --> 01:23:45,049
- Fuck! Shit, that hurts.
- What the hell?

690
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,324
- Can I have my things, please?
- Just give him his groceries.

691
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,971
Fucking hell.

692
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,521
That's 45.50.

693
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:16,211
Good God, it's Lucas.

694
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:18,681
Look at him. He's a mess.

695
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:28,841
- I'll go and speak to him.
- Let's stay here until he's gone.

696
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:36,888
Where's Fanny?

697
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,923
I don't know.

698
01:24:44,720 --> 01:24:46,324
Shit...

699
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,125
CHRISTMAS EVE

700
01:27:17,080 --> 01:27:19,560
I'd like to go in.

701
01:27:58,840 --> 01:28:03,448
A warm welcome to you all.
And merry Christmas.

702
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:07,724
This is our Christmas service.

703
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,128
As always,
we'll open with a prayer.

704
01:28:17,640 --> 01:28:21,690
I have come into this your house
to hear what you say to me,

705
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,088
God the Father, you, Lord Jesus,

706
01:28:25,200 --> 01:28:29,808
good Holy Spirit,
in life and death my comforter.

707
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:35,766
Open my heart by your Holy Spirit,
for the sake of Jesus Christ.

708
01:28:35,880 --> 01:28:40,841
So that I may learn to repent my sins
and to believe in Jesus,

709
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,249
and every day
to grow in holy life and living.

710
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:50,207
Hear me and grant this, Oh God,
through Jesus Christ. Amen.

711
01:28:56,200 --> 01:29:01,047
Christmas Eve is about Baby Jesus.

712
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:04,124
The son of God is born.

713
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:08,211
- What's wrong?
- I can tell by looking at him.

714
01:29:09,680 --> 01:29:11,444
Tell what?

715
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:18,211
We should think about it
during the Lord's Prayer.

716
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:25,487
Father, you say. And then it happens.
You have become a child of God.

717
01:29:26,760 --> 01:29:32,722
It is starting now.
Christmas time is a time for children.

718
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:37,930
This year we want to emphasize
the gospel for Christmas Day.

719
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:42,807
We've invited the nursery choir
who have been practising,

720
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:48,324
so we may enjoy the hymn
"A Child is Born in Bethlehem".

721
01:29:55,240 --> 01:29:58,084
Come on, stand over here.

722
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:07,566
Klara, you stand here.

723
01:30:09,800 --> 01:30:11,643
Take a step forward.

724
01:31:26,440 --> 01:31:30,411
What are you saying?

725
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:34,889
- Have you got something to say to me?
- Stop it, Lucas.

726
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:38,641
- You want to tell me something?
- Relax, Lucas!

727
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:42,685
The whole town is listening.
Tell me!

728
01:31:42,800 --> 01:31:48,204
- You psycho!
- What do you want to say?

729
01:31:52,440 --> 01:31:57,287
- Stop it, you fucking psychopath!
- I want a word with Theo.

730
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:02,440
Look into my eyes.
Look me in the eyes.

731
01:32:04,080 --> 01:32:08,449
What do you see?
Do you see anything?

732
01:32:09,720 --> 01:32:13,520
Nothing. There's nothing.

733
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:16,450
There's nothing.

734
01:32:18,080 --> 01:32:20,128
You leave me alone now.

735
01:32:21,200 --> 01:32:26,047
Leave me alone now, Theo.
Then I'll go. Thank you.

736
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:56,531
- You're the lucky one.
- You've had enough presents.

737
01:32:57,720 --> 01:33:00,849
It's exactly what you wished for.

738
01:33:03,600 --> 01:33:05,807
I've got her.

739
01:33:37,000 --> 01:33:38,729
Fanny...

740
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:56,408
Lucas... Hi, Lucas.

741
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:09,489
It was not supposed to happen.

742
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:23,684
Klara, honey...

743
01:34:27,360 --> 01:34:29,647
It's not Lucas. It's just Dad.

744
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:40,286
- Dad, are you crying?
- No.

745
01:34:41,960 --> 01:34:47,205
The world is full of evil.

746
01:34:48,240 --> 01:34:52,484
But if we hold on to each other,
it goes away.

747
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,491
Are you really sad?

748
01:35:00,880 --> 01:35:02,609
No.

749
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:06,240
You know,

750
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:11,810
that Lucas is my very best friend.

751
01:35:11,920 --> 01:35:17,131
We rode our mopeds...

752
01:35:17,240 --> 01:35:20,210
We stole apples and all that.
I've told you before.

753
01:35:22,040 --> 01:35:24,805
I just said something foolish.

754
01:35:27,640 --> 01:35:29,768
He didn't do anything.

755
01:35:37,760 --> 01:35:40,843
- No.
- No.

756
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:46,407
Go to sleep.

757
01:36:03,200 --> 01:36:06,602
- What are you doing?
- Just go join the others.

758
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:11,203
Who's that for?

759
01:36:12,320 --> 01:36:15,927
Give me ten minutes,
and I'll be back.

760
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:21,325
Theo.
You're not going to his place.

761
01:36:23,960 --> 01:36:27,760
Agnes, step aside.

762
01:36:51,600 --> 01:36:56,083
- Hey. Lucas...
- What are you doing here?

763
01:36:56,200 --> 01:36:57,850
It's just me.

764
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:06,801
What the hell are you doing here?

765
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:17,250
I brought you some food,
in case...

766
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:24,242
Are you hungry?

767
01:37:30,840 --> 01:37:33,923
Go ahead and eat, if you want.

768
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:40,842
It's very nice.
You can just go home, if you like.

769
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:49,205
No...

770
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:54,202
Actually,
I'd like to stay for a while.

771
01:38:54,320 --> 01:38:56,049
If it's okay.

772
01:39:53,320 --> 01:39:57,609
ONE YEAR LATER

773
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:22,002
- Ready?
- Yes.

774
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,204
- Hi, Johan.
- Hello.

775
01:40:33,960 --> 01:40:36,201
Hi, Dan. So we're back.

776
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:38,804
Lucas!

777
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:44,124
- Good to see you.
- You too.

778
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:54,283
Quiet! Shut up.
We're gathered here for a reason.

779
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:58,840
This is the day
when boys become men,

780
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,962
and men become boys.

781
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:05,642
Marcus, old boy.
You have your hunting license.

782
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:09,526
And it's your turn
tomorrow at the crack of dawn.

783
01:41:10,560 --> 01:41:13,404
You're becoming an adult.

784
01:41:13,520 --> 01:41:16,603
You're about to conquer the forest.

785
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:18,563
Come here, my boy.

786
01:41:27,920 --> 01:41:31,208
It's a great pleasure
to see you here.

787
01:41:32,680 --> 01:41:35,081
This is for you.

788
01:41:49,320 --> 01:41:52,210
I wish you were my boy,

789
01:41:52,320 --> 01:41:56,211
and that this was
a present from me.

790
01:41:56,280 --> 01:42:02,367
But it's not from me.
It's from your father.

791
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:05,723
It's been in your family
for generations,

792
01:42:05,840 --> 01:42:09,083
and now... it's yours.

793
01:42:10,240 --> 01:42:11,810
Take care of it.

794
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:16,721
Your grandfather missed
many deer

795
01:42:16,840 --> 01:42:19,047
in order to feed your family.

796
01:42:19,200 --> 01:42:22,647
Don't forget that.
Congratulations!

797
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:27,965
<i>We hope that he will drink with us,
and drink with us, and drink with us!</i>

798
01:42:28,080 --> 01:42:31,971
<i>We hope that he will drink with us,
that he will drink with us!</i>

799
01:42:32,080 --> 01:42:36,927
<i>That he will drink with us!</i>

800
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:38,405
Cheers and congratulations!

801
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:40,887
Lunch is served!

802
01:42:45,680 --> 01:42:49,127
- Do you have any more?
- We'll bring it in.

803
01:43:07,880 --> 01:43:12,522
That's tricky. Look at all
those lines you can't step on.

804
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:15,291
Yes, I was just
thinking the same.

805
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:20,207
- Hi, Klara.
- Hi.

806
01:43:21,760 --> 01:43:23,524
Are you okay?

807
01:43:35,440 --> 01:43:40,844
- How do we get around those lines?
- I don't know. There are so many.

808
01:43:40,960 --> 01:43:42,530
Yes.

809
01:43:50,680 --> 01:43:51,841
Come.

810
01:43:58,000 --> 01:43:59,365
Careful now.

811
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:04,531
Very long steps...

812
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:09,121
We made it.
I think your dad is in there.

813
01:44:12,200 --> 01:44:13,964
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

814
01:44:30,400 --> 01:44:34,962
- You're scaring the deer.
- What am I doing?

815
01:44:37,280 --> 01:44:40,523
- Did I ruin everything?
- No, it'll be back.

816
01:44:41,200 --> 01:44:46,650
Marcus. Go wait by your deer stand.
You'll wait a while but they'll come.

817
01:44:48,560 --> 01:44:50,403
Are you ready?
